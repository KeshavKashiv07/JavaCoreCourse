Algrotham :-

step1: start

step2: set the name , department , salary of the employees

step3: set the variabls, which we want to calculate

step4: put If condition to choses department is sale 

step5: for calculate the bonous putng that particular (2%/100)*annualsalary formula to get bonous

step6: taking another if condition for comparing the bonous to max bonous for geting higest bonous

step7: taking loop for geting the total bonous amount of employess

step8: for calculate the average bonous, puting formula to get average bonous

step9: stop





Pseudocode :-

Begin

print("Enter employee name")
Get emp_name

print("Enter employee department")
Get emp_dept

print("Enter employee salary")
Get salary
anualsalary = 12*salary

bonous
higest_bonous = 0 
total_bonous_amt = 0 
bonous_avg

for(i=1; i<=7; i++)
begin
if(emp_dept == "sale")
begin

   bonous = (2/100)*anualsalary
   
    if(bonous > higest_bonous)
     begin
       higest_bonous = bonous
     end
         
     total_bonous_amt = total_bonous_amt + bonous
       
 
   bonous_avg = total_bonous_amt/3
   
end
end

print(bonous)
print(higest_bonous)
print(emp_name)
print(total_bonous_amt)
print(bonous_avg)

End
